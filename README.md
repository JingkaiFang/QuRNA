# Quantum algorithm for identifying RNA 3D motifs

This project is a modified version of the original [Qiskit Community Subgraph Isomorphism](https://github.com/qiskit-community/subgraph-isomorphism) algorithm, which provides quantum approaches for subgraph isomorphism detection.

## ðŸ”§ Modifications

This version includes the following changes:

- Modified the quantum circuit structure.
- Added ancillary qubits to encode edge or node weights.

These enhancements aim to enable weighted subgraph isomorphism encoding and extend the original algorithmâ€™s applicability.

## ðŸ“¦ Based On

This code is originally based on the open-source project:
